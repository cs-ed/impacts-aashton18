# Impacts on Society

## Program Overview
Serving grades 6th-8th, Riverside Meadows Intermediate School is the first K-12 school within Yuba County to bring a fully developed Computer Science program to students. Understanding that high-tech industries produce nearly one-fourth of the country’s economic output and computing occupations are the fastest-growing career field, Plumas Lake Elementary School District is working to pilot a new elective program to excite interest in Computer Science in the middle school grades.

## Course Name
Introduction to Computer Science

## Course Description
This elective class is an introductory computer science course covering various activities, including problem-solving, programming, user-centered design, and machine learning. Students will learn to build websites, apps, animations, and games using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Grade Level
This is a year-long elective course meeting daily for 52 minutes. Three periods are offered for Introduction to Computer Science. One is for 6th-grade students and is paced accordingly. The other two are for 7th-8th grade students. 

## Context
Currently, the three periods of Introduction to Computer Science comprise sixty-three students.  Fifty-six identify as male (89%), and seven identify as female (11%).  Of these sixty-three students, 67% are caucasian (school average 45%), 6% are African American (school average 4.5%), 6% are Hispanic (school average 31%), and 21% are Asian (school average 7%).  One student is an English Language Learner (school average 3.3%), and 14% have Individualized Educational Plans.  Based on the school site average of 43.6% for socioeconomically disadvantaged students, it could be assumed that twenty-seven students from these three classes would come from low-income households.

## Unit Overview
Classroom discussion on the impacts of computing within society will be integrated into the second chapter of Code.org’s Computer Science Discoveries Unit 2, Web Development curriculum.  The initial kick-off for this unit will begin with a whole class viewing of the documentary “At Your Fingertips,” which follows three young individuals studying and working in computer science.  As they road trip across the United States, they meet with different professionals who represent underrepresented populations within the industry to learn about what they do and the challenges they faced.  This viewing will not only introduce students to various career fields but begin the conversation about the current lack of representation within the computer science profession.

With the primary unit focus of building multi-page websites, student teams will develop HTML and CSS skills while simultaneously researching careers fields within the technology sector.  Each student on the team will select a different career field and create a webpage showcasing information for that role per rubric criteria.  Student teams will then link their separate websites together to serve as a resource website, thereby meeting the main objective of Unit 2, Chapter 2, while completing the secondary purpose of learning about computer science career opportunities. Students will explore their selected computer science career path, research the current and projected labor needs for that profession, the current demographic make-up, and reflect on the potential barriers to entry for various ethnic/social-economic groups.

## Unit Learning Objectives & Activities

- Activities - Using data collected from a Google Form from all three Intro to Computer Science classes and information from the most current school site SARC report, students will summarize findings. First, student pairs will calculate the percentage of representation for identified gender and ethnic groups from the class and within the school.  Using additional teacher-provided resources, they will then calculate rates found in the computer science industry.  Student pairs will then visually represent the data, comparing percentages found within the class as a percentage of the school population to those represented in the computer science industry compared to a whole of the US population.  Students pairs will present their findings to the class. Finally, a whole group discussion will be used to discuss similarities and differences found between the computer science class representations and that of the computer science industry. Data analysis collected from this lesson will be later incorporated into the main page of each team’s website.

## Assessment
Students will be assessed using three tiers.  The first tier will be a team member’s self-assessment of their group project, their website of a selected computer science career field, and their contribution to their team.  The second tier of assessment will be team members' assessment of each other’s contribution to the group project and their ability to work together.  The teacher will conduct the final evaluation.  A final project rubric will be used to assess each team’s website.  The rubric criteria will evaluate groups based on having a specific website purpose, accurate data and reflective commentary of population representations within the computer science industry, a clear understanding of a career field within the tech sector, proper HTML & CSS syntax, code readability, website style, and citation use.

## Outcomes
During this unit, students will have the opportunity to learn about different career fields within the computer science industry that could potentially spark their interest in their future studies. In addition, students will have the opportunity to explore some of the current and potential obstacles to entry into these career fields towards identified population groups. Finally, using data from within their computer classroom to that of the school, students will be able to identify existing gaps in representation at the local level.  Exposing students to these concerning trends while simultaneously presenting the enormous opportunity potentially awaiting them in this career field may, hopefully, start to support a positive rise of a more diverse representation within the computer science industry in the years ahead.
